# GradPlanner 

Cloned from repository (for CSCI 187 project): https://github.com/xiaogong1/Course-Planner

A web application that generates a four-year plan for Santa Clara University students based on their needs.

Originally named PlanForGrad.

## Setup
Refer to the wiki: https://github.com/park-junha/PlanForGrad/wiki

## Running
1. On your terminal, run `python3 main.py`, with the database password as your first command line argument.
2. Navigate to `localhost:5000` on your browser to access the frontend.

You may have to create and activate a virtual environment before running the above steps.

### Common Errors
Make sure all dependencies are installed. You can do this with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

Try using a virtual environment. You can follow steps on how to do that [here](https://github.com/park-junha/PlanForGrad/wiki/Running). You will also need to `source` the virtual environment before running the Python app every time.

Contact jpark3@scu.edu if you are having difficulties running the app.
